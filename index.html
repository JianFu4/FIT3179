<h1 >FROM ACCESS TO IMPACT: GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE ENEGRY TRENDS </h1>

<h5 id = "subheader" > From 2000 to 2020 </h5>


<p id = "bold">
    Over these twenty years, the world has witnessed remarkable strides in ensuring energy access for all. 
    As the world has steered towards more sustainable energy practices, the environmental dividends are palpable.
    A declining trend in carbon dioxide emissions per person is a good sign while it shows the efforts in adopting renewable energy 
    and reducing dependency on fossil fuels.

    GLOBAL OVERVIEW

<p class = "desc">
    Through this map, we can see the distribution of the primary energy consumption in a big picture. 
    We discover that throughout the years, the energy consumed has <span style="color: green;">increased</span>.
    However, we can see a <span style="color: red;">decrease</span> in energy consumption happening in <span style="color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">Europe</span>

    Over the span of 20 years, the electricity generation landscape has exhibited intriguing trends.
    Notably, the proportion of electricity derived from <span style="color: #e6a57e;">fossil fuels</span> has remained relatively stable. 
    At the same time, <span style="color: #90be6d;">renewable energy</span> sources have progressively <span style="color: green;">increased</span> their share, gradually encroaching upon the portion previously dominated by <span style="color: #f9c74f;">nuclear</span> energy.
</p>
<p class = "desc">
    A comparative assessment across five distinct regions provides further depth into the energy dynamics.A notable observation is the gradual <span style="color: red;">decline</span> in <span style="color: #e6a57e;">fossil fuels</span> usage within the <span style="color: orange;">Americas</span> year by year.
    In contrast, <span style="color: #90be6d;">renewable energy</span>, particularly in <span style="color: palevioletred;">Asia</span>, showcases <span style="color: green;"> a promising growth trend</span>, reinforcing the global shift towards sustainable energy sources.

    OVERVIEW AND DETAILS
</h2>
<p class = "desc">
    We aim to explore the correlation between CO2 emmisions and electricity produced by <span style="color: #e6a57e;">fossil fuels</span>. It is evident from the data that these two variables are intrinsically linked.
    A <span style="color: green;">rise</span> in electricity generation from fossil fuels invariably leads to <span style="color: green;">increased</span> CO2 emissions. A noteworthy observation is <span style="color: palevioletred;">China's</span> escalating trend in both electricity production from fossil fuels and CO2 emissions.
    Remarkably, within a span of two decades, <span style="color: palevioletred;">China</span> surpassed the <span style="color: orange;">United States</span> in this regard. By selecting a specific country's data point on the scatter plot, users can view the corresponding historical trend on the line chart.
