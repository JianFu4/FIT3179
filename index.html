<h1>FROM ACCESS TO IMPACT: GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE ENEGRY TRENDS </h1>

<h5> From 2000 to 2020 </h5>
<h3>
    Over these twenty years, the world has witnessed remarkable strides in ensuring energy access for all. 
    As the world has steered towards more sustainable energy practices, the environmental dividends are palpable.
    A declining trend in carbon dioxide emissions per person is a good sign while it shows the efforts in adopting renewable energy 
    and reducing dependency on fossil fuels.

<h2>
    GLOBAL OVERVIEW
</h2>
<h4>
    Through this map, we can see the distribution of the primary energy consumption in a big picture. We discover that throughout the years, the energy consumed has increased.
     We can notice by viewing a larger circle occur in the world <map name="" class=""></map>

<h2>
    COMPARE BETWEEN CATEGORY
</h2>
<h4>
    By refering to the donut chart, we can compare the proportion of energy generated by each source. In addition, in the sub chart, we can see the portion of energy generated in that source by each region.

<h2> 
    OVERVIEW AND DETAILS
</h2>
<h4>
    We focus on the relationship between the value of CO2 emmision and electricity generated by fossil fuels. We can see how they are obviously related. When there are more electricity generated by fossil fuels, we can expect to have higher CO2 emmision also. When we click on the country data point on the scatter plot, the country's trend will show on the line chart.
